An Integrated Landscape Hallmark of Prognostic and Therapeutic Significance Related to Zinc Finger Proteins and Immune Infiltration in Liver CancerAn Integrated Landscape Hallmark of Prognostic and Therapeutic Significance Related to Zinc Finger Proteins and Immune Infiltration in Liver Cancer
Liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of zinc finger proteins in cancer development, functioning as crucial regulators of DNA repair, gene expression, and cellular differentiation. Similarly, the immune infiltration within the tumor microenvironment (TME) has emerged as a critical determinant of cancer progression and response to therapy. This project proposes an integrative analysis to explore the combined effects of zinc finger protein expression and immune cell infiltration in liver cancer, aiming to identify novel prognostic markers and therapeutic targets.Liver cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide.
